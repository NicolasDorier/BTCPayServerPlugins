Use Cases:
Membership Payments:
Allow Ghost users to pay for memberships via Bitcoin using BTCPay Server.
Automatically update the membership status in Ghost once payment is confirmed.
Donation Pages:
Create custom donation pages for Ghost posts or pages, linked to BTCPay Server invoices.
Subscription Renewals:
Automate Bitcoin payments for recurring memberships (handled manually since BTCPay doesn’t natively support subscriptions... until subscription plugin is complete).
